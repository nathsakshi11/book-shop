Cinderella was very excited about the ball. In the attic, she found a dress that had belonged to her mother.t was a bit old-fashioned, but Cinderella could make it beautiful!Lady Tremaine didn't want Cinderella to go to the ball. She wanted the Prince to meet Anastasia and Drizella. Maybe he would marry one of them!Lady Tremaine kept Cinderella busy with chores that would take her all night to finish.While Cinderella was working, the mice and birds fixed her dress. They added ribbons and beads that the two stepsisters had thrown away.Working together, the animals turned a simple dress into a fabulous gown!Cinderella was overjoyed when she saw the dress. Now she could go to the ball!"Oh, thank you so much!" Cinderella said to Gus, Jaq, and the birds.When the stepsisters saw their old ribbons and beads on Cinderella's dress, they flew into a rage.They ripped the dress and pulled off the beads. Lady Tremaine didn't stop them. Cinderella's dream of going to the ball was through.Cinderella ran away to the garden to cry. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared.With a wave of her wand, she turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. Cinderella could now go to the ball, but her dress was still ruined.

"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" said the Fairy Godmother, waving her wand again. Cinderella was now wearing a beautiful gown and sparkling glass slippers.But all of this came with a warning: When the clock struck midnight, the magic spell would wear off!At the ball, Prince Charming couldn't take his eyes off Cinderella.The orchestra played, and the Prince began to dance with the wonderful girl whose name he still didn't know. For Cinderella, the night was a dream come true.Before too long, the clock began to strike midnight. "Good-bye!" Cinderella said, hurrying away."Come back!" called the Prince. "I don't even know your name!" As Cinderella fled, one of her glass slippers came off.

The Prince sent the Grand Duke to find the girl who fit the glass slipper. Lady Tremaine locked Cinderella in the attic, but Cinderella's mouse friends freed her.The Prince sent the Grand Duke to find the girl who fit the glass slipper.

As they sang a song of love together, Snow White's evil stepmother, the Queen, watched them.The Queen was so jealous of Snow White's beauty that she ordered her Huntsman to kill the young princess.But the Huntsman couldn't bring himself to hurt Snow White. He told her to run far away so the Queen would never find herSnow White ran deep into the woods. She was lost and scared but soon found herself in front of a cottageThe princess knocked, but no one was home. She slowly stepped inside.The cottage was a mess! With the help of her forest friends, Snow White cleaned every nook and cranny"Maybe whoever lives here will let me stay," said Snow WhiteUpstairs, Snow White found seven little beds. She thought they belonged to children.Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned as she curled up on the beds and fell asleepMeanwhile, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in a jewel mine. They were anxious to get home to their cottage in the woodsThe Seven Dwarfs were surprised when they found a princess inside their home!When Snow White awoke, she was charmed by the Seven Dwarfs: Dopey, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, and SleepyThe Dwarfs wanted to protect the beautiful princess from the evil queen, so they invited Snow White to live with themTo celebrate, the new friends sang and danced the night awayBack at the castle, the Queen learned that Snow White was still aliveEnraged, she made a magic potion to change her appearance. Her plan was to trick the princess.After the Dwarfs had set off for work the next day, the Queen, disguised as an old peddler woman, offered Snow White a beautiful red appleSnow White took one bite of the apple and fell into a deep sleep. The Queen had poisoned her!When the Dwarfs came home, they chased the Queen to the top of a stormy mountain. Suddenly, lightning hit the mountain, and the Queen fell, never to be seen again.But Snow White was still in a deep sleep. The Seven Dwarfs kept watch over her day and nightFinally, Snow White's Prince Charming arrived. He had been searching everywhere for the beautiful princess he had sung with so long agoThe Prince awakened Snow White with Love's First Kiss. The spell was broken!

She cast her spell to soften Maleficent's curseNow Aurora would not die when she pricked her finger. She would simply fall into a deep slumber, only to be awakened with True Love's KissHowever, the king and his queen were still very concerned about the safety of their daughterAnd so with heavy hearts, they agreed that the three good fairies, disguised as peasant women, would raise the child in secret far away from the castleOver the years, the child grew into a beautiful young woman who made friends with all of the forest animalsHer three aunties called her Briar Rose and surrounded her with love. But they never told her the secret of her past On the day of her sixteenth birthday, Briar Rose still did not know that she was a princessShe spent the morning singing to her friends about how she'd had a glorious dreamIn it, she'd met the most wonderful prince. Briar Rose was convinced he was her true loveLittle did Briar Rose know, a prince was passing nearby at that moment. He was Prince Phillip, the very prince that the king and queen had planned for her to marryPhillip didn't know that Briar Rose was a princess either. But he was so taken with her beautiful song, he hopped off his horsePhillip emerged from the trees, and as he and Briar Rose sang and danced together, she realized that this man reminded her of the prince in her dreamsShe felt as if she'd always known him. Briar Rose was excited for him to meet her aunties, so she invited him to come to the cottage that eveningShe knew that she was falling in loveBut when Briar Rose returned to the cottage, her aunties told her that they were good fairies and she was a princessShe was supposed to return to her parents' castle that night. There she would meet the prince she was already engaged to marryBriar Rose was overcome with sadness. She only wanted to marry the man she had just met, her dream princeWhen Aurora arrived at the castle, the three fairies left her alone to mourn. But Maleficent soon appeared to make sure her curse came trueShe put Aurora in a trance and led the princess to a spindle hidden high in the castle. There, Aurora pricked her finger and fell into a deep sleepWhen the three fairies found Aurora, they realized that Maleficent's evil curse had come trueThey took the sleeping princess to the tower room and then cast a deep sleep over the whole kingdomNow they had to find Aurora's true love from the forest so he could give her True Love's KissIt didn't take the three fairies long to recognize that Prince Phillip was the man Aurora had met in the forest - her betrothed was her true love!But he was in Maleficent's dungeon. The fairies freed him and then armed him with the Sword of Truth and the Shield of VirtueNow he was prepared to fight the evil fairy and save Aurora!But the evil fairy was not easy to defeatBack at the castle, Phillip came face-to-face with Maleficent, who had transformed herself into a giant, fire-breathing dragonHowever, with the help of the three good fairies, Phillip was able to send his sword flying swift and sureWith Maleficent gone, Phillip rushed to Aurora's side and bestowed a gentle kiss upon her lips. Aurora's eyes fluttered open - the curse had been brokenWhen she saw her beloved, the man from the forest, she smiled. Now the prince and princess could live happily ever after The End.</p>
